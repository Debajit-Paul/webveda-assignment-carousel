              It wasn't only about the language, vocabulary, fluency or
              storytelling as people speak of it. Even though we've heard of how
              important it is to be a good story teller, the part in this course
              on story telling and communication was more about how to tell our
              story in alignment with knowing audience. Because it is going to
              decide which story, tone and the feel of it.

                      It wasn't only about the language, vocabulary, fluency or
                      storytelling as people speak of it. Even though we've
                      heard of how important it is to be a good story teller,
                      the part in this course on story telling and communication
                      was more about how to tell our story in alignment with
                      knowing audience. Because it is going to decide which
                      story, tone and the feel of it.
